ALSound v3.1 - Jan 13, 2026
------------------------------
> ALSound is now a package. Download the lib, under Lazarus open the package 'ALSoundPackage.lpk' in source folder, compile. You can now add the package to your project.
> Updated examples with the package
> New feature: when a sound is looped, now we can set the start and end position to loop.
> Added dsp routine
> Added missing comment for property TALSSound.OnStopped
> Fixed: wrong argument type for alBufferiv() last parameter
> Removed compilation hints

------------------------------
ALSound v3.0.3 - Aug 29, 2024
------------------------------
> New property SampleCount to TALSSound.
> Fix: loop issue on streamed sounds. In sound of particular length, the stream process don't allow loop. This is now fixed.
> Warning this change breaks compatibility with previous release.
To be more explicit, type TVolumeCurve is renamed to TVolumeMode, ALS_VOLUME_CURVE_LINEAR to ALS_VOLUME_MODE_LINEAR and ALS_VOLUME_CURVE_SQUARED to ALS_VOLUME_MODE_SQUARED.
Also property ALSManager.VolumeCurve is renamed to ALSManager.VolumeMode.
> Fix: Added missing code to free the sound when calling TALSSound.PlayThenKill(). Before the fix, PlayThenKill() play the sound but did not free it.
> Added log warning for each sounds not freed by the app. This is just for information, sounds are always freed automatically when the context is freed.

------------------------------
ALSound v3.0.2 - Jul 21, 2024
------------------------------
> Replaced OpenAL 64b binary by a new one compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.
> Added the ability to update a playback context by the application instead of the internal thread.
> ALSManager have now a global volume mode property called VolumeMode. Its value can be:
  - ALS_VOLUME_MODE_LINEAR: it's the normal mode.
  - ALS_VOLUME_MODE_SQUARED: the volume values are squared before to be sent to OpenAL-Soft. This is usefull if you want the audio sliders in your application to better match human hearing.
 Warning: this feature affects the behavior of velocity curves.
> Some example demo are been updated with VolumeMode sets to ALS_VOLUME_MODE_SQUARED.
> Reduced the capture to playback latency.
> Added new method TALSSound.FadeOutThenPause().

------------------------------
ALSound v3.0.1 - Mar 30, 2024
------------------------------
> Fixed a bug in function ALSOpenAudioFile() under Windows.
> Renamed all classes in als_velocity_curve.inc with prefix TALS.
> updated examples.
> Added prefix als to enum TALSParamState.
> Added a missing initialization when opening a sound file.
> remove compiler hint.
> Simplified the code to load the OpenALSoft and LibSndFile libraries.

------------------------------
ALSound v3.0.0 - Aug 25, 2023
------------------------------

> Removed some compilation hints.
> Improved error handling when libraries are not loaded.
> Removed some potential bugs.
> Added support for MacOS (x86-64).
> Better error handling when creating effect on TALSPlaybackContext.
> Renamed some types and functions in respect of openalsoft.
> updated example to run on MacOS platform.
> Added an additional volume control in TALSSound.

------------------------------
ALSound v2.1.0 - Jun 20, 2023
------------------------------
> Added method to manage audio file metadata.
> Added routine to split/interleaved audio channels.
> Added bitrate mode constants.
> Added compression level to TALSLoopbackContext.
> Simplified the capture to file process.
> Restructured capturing errors messages.
> Added SampleRate property to loopback context. 

------------------------------
ALSound v2.0.0 - Feb 15, 2023
------------------------------
> Sound can now jump to another time position.
> Time position can now be set before playing a sound.
> Added Pause to capture context.
> Added method to fill buffer with silence.
> Added routines for dB <-> Linear conversion with better names.
> Fixed a bug in routine dsp_Mean_Float.
> Added a callback when a sound is stopped.
> Added a way to cancel a mixing.
> Added dsp_AmplifySample_xxxxx routine for small int and float.
> Increased the playback context thread priority.
> Fixed a bug in Loopback context with float sample type.

------------------------------
ALSound v1.3.0 - Nov 12, 2022
------------------------------
> Modified the period update of TALSCaptureContext from 10ms to 2ms to avoid audio's artifacts with live playback.
> Channel's level: Moved Sqrt() function from dsp_ComputeLinearLevel_xxxx routines to TALSFrameBufferBase.
> Added callback OnCaptureBuffer to TALSCaptureContext.
> Update capture examples to use this callback.
> Increase the number of buffer from 8 to 32 for TALSPlaybackCapturedSound to avoid the playback to stall.
> Added a read only property EffectType to TALSEffect.
> Added some code to unchain an effect when it is deleted.
> Added OnCustomDSP property for TALSSound. This property allow to define a callback to apply a custom user DSP effects on an audio buffer before sending it to OpenAL-Soft.
> Rewrite TALSPlaybackCapturedSound.QueueBuffer(...): previously, OpenAL-Soft sometime return an error because an attempt to refill a queued buffer occurs. We changed the buffer's management strategy to avoid this problem.
> Removed unit LCLTranslator from ALSound unit.
> Removed some fixed string and added a method to rename a TALSPlaybackCapturedSound sound's instance.
> Rewrite TALSManager.DialogFileFilters: now you have to specify the string associated with Sound File filters and All File filter.
> Updated all examples that use TALSManager.DialogFileFilters function.

------------------------------

> Added method TALSPlaylist.Delete(Index: integer).
> Added the ability to TALSCaptureContext to playback captured audio in real time.
> Added property ChannelsPeakdB[Index:integer]: single to TALSCaptureContext.
