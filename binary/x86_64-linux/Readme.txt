the Linux 64bits OpenAL-Soft library was compiled from sources on a Win10 machine + VirtualBox + Ubuntu 20.04 64b + CMake + CMake-gui
the libsndfile.so was compiled with the script from https://github.com/bastibe/libsndfile-binaries

Source for OpenAL-Soft can be found on https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft

Source for LibSndFile can be found on https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile

If you build them yourself from source, don't forget to rename the obtained binaries to
	libopenal.so and libsndfile.so
and put a copy in this folder.
